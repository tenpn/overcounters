# overcounters

Whenever I play with a new synth, I mess around with the Close Encounters music: G4 A4 F4 F3 C4.

Doing the same thing with the Overtone synth interface for Clojure. Except now I can write something that generates music using that progression!

## Usage

brew install leiningen // first time only

cd overcounters

lein deps // first time only

lein repl

(use 'overcounters.core)
